    <b>What Opportunities I'm applying for</b>
<p>
    There are so many opportunities within Sky that really interest me, and out of those available on Pathways, 
    I've narrowed it down to  front runners, I know that's still a little high. I want to make it clear, I wouldn't
    be aiming to do all 5 if I were succcesful in getting onto Pathways, but these 5 are all roles I think I'd excel in
</p><p>
    They are in order of preference:
    <li>Digital Frontline Analyst</li>
    <li>Associate Data Analyst</li>
    <li>Business Resilience & Fault Ananlyst</li>
    <li>Cyber Security Compliance Analyst</li>
    <li>Technical Resilience Analyst</li>
</p><p>
    I seem to be drawn to roles titled Analyst in some way, which makes sense, as I'v always been someone drawn to numbers,
    logical processes, and efficiency
</p><p>
    I think I'd be a fantastic fit for the Digital Frontline Analyst, as my recent secondment has given me a unique insight 
    into the role, as my customer interactions have all been in the digital space. This helps me to understand their 
    frustrations with it, the advisors frustrations with it, and a passion to improve it for those reasons,as I understand well
    the friction points we'd be looking to resolve from that perspective
</p><p>
    I hope my passion, and work to create this website helps you to see what I can offer, while it may not be the prettiest 
    website, I don't think that should take away from what I aimed to do, which was show my creativity, in a way that's more 
    me. I'm not artistic, I'm a creator,  and I wanted to offer something unique, that noone else will do.
