    <b>What I bring </b><br>
    <p>
        I bring a different set of skills then most advisors in Leeds, due to my secondment
        I have a unique insight into the online journey that our customers go through, as I've been
        a part of that for the last 8 months.
        </p><p>
        One of the best things we did while I was there was launch a new processes, the launch
        of the Live Labs queue, aimed at reducing the outbound of advisors across the Home Move estate,
        by removing the requirements of individual agents to take time away from customers reviewing
        cases, though also providing almost instant feedback to help agents improve whenever there
        was a gap in their knowledge in regards to CRFs.
    </p><p>
        I also bring an understanding of coding, while this isn't necessarily going to be used in the roles
        I'm going to be doing, this is a skill I am hoping to use with Sky long term, and this
        is a way for me to begin to establish a way to utilise this skill for the business, by starting
        in a team that is software & coding adjacent.
    </p><p> 
        While not necessarily unique, I think my work ethic, and commitment to trying something new
        and succeeding at it, is something else that I bring, I have a drive to learn, and this project
        is proof of that. I had no clue how to do what I've created for you when the application opened,
        and now look where we are.
    </p><p>
        As far as I know, the people this application will definitely be read by, know what I did for
        Lean into Leadership, which was to build a circuit board with a programmed LCD screen, this is
        something new and different.
