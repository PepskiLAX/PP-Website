    <b>Why I want this</b><br><br>
    <menu>
        I want this, because I want an opportunity to showcase what I can do, I've demonstrated
that I'll succeed even in difficult situations, like on my most recent secondment, where I
worked with a team based out of Livingston, on our messaging platform to book Home
Moves. It might sound no more difficult than what others do, but working as an isolated
person remote to my team, has presented it's own set of challenges, mostly the lack of
support, which I rose to, and overcame.
<br><br>
I want to mention this wasn't that people weren't willing, just the reality of my situation
<br><br>
But I want more opportunities, during that time I've found out more about what I want,
and what I can do for other areas of the business, where I can put my talents, and learned
skills to more us.
<br><br>
I think it's fair to say I've got more to offer and I want to challenge myself to do
that, and to be an asset to the Pathways experience.
