    <b>Who I Am</b><br>
<p>
    If you're from Leeds you'll probably know me, I'm one of the people that has been
    part of the CSG journey in Leeds since Service began here, I'm dedicated, hard-working
    and have been part of a lot of projects already.
</p><p>
    I am now (though maybe a little bit less than before), one of the go to people round Leeds
    for solving problems, and dealing with the complex. I enjoy taking on new challenges
    and can't wait to get stuck into this one.   
</p>
<p>
    I have a lot of things that I do beyond my role, and one of the big changes that I've had 
    recently is the birth of my son (pictured on page 1), it's been a massive adjustment, but something 
    I'm so proud of.
</p>
<p>
    I also play sport when I can, and train on Monday evenings with the local Ice Hockey team
    and am looking to start playing lacrosse again in the near future, as my schedule will now allow
    me to do this as well. When I have any other spare time, it's usually spent doing something like
    spending time with family, dabbling in code basics or gaming.
