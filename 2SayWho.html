    <b>Who I Am</b><br>
<p>
    If you're from Leeds you'll probably know me, I'm one of the people that has been
    part of the CSG journey in Leeds since Service began here, I'm dedicated, hard-working
    and have been part of a lot of projects already
</p><p>
    I am now (though maybe a little bit less than before), one of the go to people round Leeds
    for solving problems, and dealing with the complex. I enjoy taking on new challenges
    and can't wait to get stuck into this one
